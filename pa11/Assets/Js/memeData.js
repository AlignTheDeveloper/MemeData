I think as long as it is done in a fun, humorous, respectful (obviously not portraying him as a killer or terrorist or something), and entertaining way then I think there is nothing wrong with it. Jack is a great professor and has a great personal relationship with his students. I feel he will mention if something is posted that is not school appropriate. As long as having to take down non-school appropriate memes is not a regular or common occurrence I think these are a great way for GIMM to express each cohort's personality."
