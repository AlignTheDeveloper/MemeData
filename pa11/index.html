                <h1>What topic is your narrative about?</h1>
                <p>For my narrative, I decided to collect data about the general consensus that the GIMM community has reached 
                concerning the nature of the GIMM 260 Meme Channel and community. I chose this topic because I am one of the main 
                contributers to the GIMM 260 Meme Channel and I was interested in what the rest of our major's opinion on the channel 
                was. To collect the data for my narrative I constructed a questionaire that asked for some basic information from the 
                person filling it out. Then, I asked Jeanne to send the questionaire out in an email and on the GIMM discord. I also 
                posted a link to the questionaire in every discord/discord channel related to GIMM and memes to get as many responses 
                as I could. By the end of it, I received 52 responses and had oodles of data to sift through.

                <h1>Were there any specific questions you wanted to answer?</h1>
                <p>Yes actually! When I created my google forms questionaire, I made a "crossroads question". 
                That question was:
                </p>
                <h4>Have you heard about the GIMM260 Jack Memes?</h4>
                <p>From this question, depending on the answer, the person taking the questionaire would be directed to 
                one of two different sections.</p>

                why they haven't heard about the memes and gave them the option to view the memes if they wanted to. (I gave
                them a link to the discord hehe)

                <ul>
                    <li>They were in the GIMM 260 Discord yet</li>

                <h4>Awareness and Engagement: </h4>
                <p>There is a notable awareness of the GIMM260 Jack Memes among the students, particularly within the 7th and 
                8th cohorts (which account for 62.7% of the respondents). This suggests that the memes could be a recognizable 
                part of the student experience in this program. Of those that filled out the questionnaire, 37/52 (71.2%) had 
                heard about the memes.

            <div class="col-3">
                <h4>Perception of Community and Culture: </h4>
                <p>Of the 71.2% of responders who had heard of the memes, 30/37 (81.1%)  believe that they well represent the 
                culture of GIMM and contribute to a sense of unity. This indicates that the memes could be playing a positive 
                role in building community within the program.

            </div>
            <div class="col-3">
                <h4>Impact on Program Image: </h4>
                <p>Of those who responded, no one thought that the memes were crossing a line and 35/37 (94.6%) of them answered that the memes were in good humor.
                This positive reception suggests that the memes are contributing favorably to the program's image, at least among those who are aware of them.

            <div class="col-3">
                <h4>Subject's Perception:</h4>
                <p>Many students believe that Professor Polifka is amused by the memes, suggesting that they are seen as a respectful and light-hearted addition 
                to the community.

                <h4>Meme Styles and Preferences: </h4>
                <p>The most commonly encountered style of meme is "Jack's face on a famous character," (25/37 or 67.6% of those that had heard of the memes) 
                It is also one of the styles found most amusing.                 
                </p>
                <h6>The exact percentages were: </h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>Jack's face as a texture on a 3D modeled sphere - 13/37 or 35.1%</li>
                    <li>Jacks face on a famous character - 12/37 or 32.4%</li>
                    <li>Jack's face in a popular meme format - 9/37 or 24.3%</li>
                    <li>Steel Blue related “other” responses - 2/37 or 5.4%</li>
                    <li>Both Popular meme and 3D sphere “other” responses - 1/37 or 2.7% (they couldn’t choose lol)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This preference for a specific style could guide the creation of future memes to better align with popular taste.

                <h4>Diversity in Engagement: </h4>
                <p>While most of the respondents have heard of these memes, 15/52 (28.8%) of them had not. This could indicate an 
                opportunity to broaden the reach of these memes within the community or to explore different platforms or methods for sharing them.

            <div class="col-4">
                <h4>Professor Engagement: </h4>
                <p>The data includes 2 responses from a professor, though one of the “professors” also said they were from the ninth cohort so 
                I am speculative of the authenticity of their response. Also, (unless it was a poser) Professor Polifka himself was one of the 
                respondents! I won't out him too much, but for those that are wondering, his favorite memes were the ones of him on a famous character 
                and he believes the memes are in good humor!

                <h4>Feedback and Further Engagement: </h4>
                <p>Of those who had not heard of the memes, 13/15 (86.7%) expressed interest in viewing the memes to provide further feedback, indicating 
                an active interest in this aspect of the community culture.

                <h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>
                <p>It's important to note that these conclusions are drawn from a limited dataset and might not fully represent the entire GIMM community. 
                Additionally, the data is self-reported and subjective, which can introduce biases. A more comprehensive analysis, possibly including 
                a larger sample size or additional data points, could provide deeper insights.
